This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](projecteuler.net). Solutions are implemented
using python and / or scala.


If, for whatever reason, you want to run this code, simply type

    python test.py

    or

    python test.py <solution number>


To run the python code you need python >= 2.7.0 and the termcolor package. The scala code
only needs a recent version of sbt (>=0.13.5)
